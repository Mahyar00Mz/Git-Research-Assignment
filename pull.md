Pull

Pull is a Git command used to update a local repository with the latest changes from a remote repository. It retrieves new commits from the remote source and integrates them into the current local branch. This process helps ensure that a developer’s local code stays synchronized with the shared project, especially when multiple people are contributing to the same repository.
