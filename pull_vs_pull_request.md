Difference between Pull, Pull Request, and Push

Push is used to upload local commits from a developer’s computer to a remote repository on GitHub. Pull is used to download and integrate updates from a remote repository into the local working copy. A pull request, on the other hand, is a GitHub-based process that requests the integration of changes after they have been reviewed and approved. Each of these actions serves a different purpose in the collaboration workflow.
