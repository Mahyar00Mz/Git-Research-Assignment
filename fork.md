Fork

A fork is a copy of an existing GitHub repository that is created under your own GitHub account. Forking allows a user to work independently on a project without making any changes to the original repository. This is especially useful in open-source projects, where contributors can safely experiment, fix bugs, or add new features. After making changes in the forked repository, contributors can propose their changes to the original project by creating a pull request.
