# Fork vs Clone in GitHub

## Fork
When a repository is forked, GitHub creates a new repository under the user’s account that is linked to the original repository. This connection allows collaboration while keeping the forked project independent. No files are downloaded to the local machine during this process, as everything remains on GitHub’s servers.

## Clone
When a repository is cloned, Git downloads the full project history, including all commits and branches, to the local system. A remote connection named `origin` is automatically created, pointing to the original repository. This setup allows the developer to manage versions locally and synchronize changes with the remote repository when needed.
