Clone

Cloning is the process of downloading a complete copy of a repository from GitHub to your local computer. When a repository is cloned, all project files, commit history, and branches are copied locally. This allows developers to work on the project offline, track changes, and create new commits. If the user has permission, these changes can later be pushed back to the remote repository on GitHub.
