Pull Request

A pull request is a GitHub feature that allows developers to propose changes from one branch or fork to another repository or branch. It provides a structured way for team members to review code, discuss improvements, and request modifications before merging changes. Pull requests play a key role in collaboration by improving code quality and reducing errors in shared projects.
